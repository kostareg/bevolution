## Bevolution

Using Rust's Bevy game engine to simulate thousands of small neural networks interacting and evolving in a 3 dimensional time-based environment. The following video shows a sample simulation where only entities in the top right survive. Notice how entities tend to learn to move to the top right over each generation, until eventually all survive. For more description, see the 2 dimensional version [evolution-rs](https://github.com/kostareg/evolution-rs).
